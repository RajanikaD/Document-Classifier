# üìÑ TensorFlow Document Classifier

This project provides a full implementation to train and deploy a document classification model using the **TensorFlow Object Detection API**. The objective is to identify whether a scanned document is a **PAN Card** or not, based on its visual features.

## üß† Project Summary

Managing KYC documents manually is time-consuming and prone to error. This classifier leverages computer vision and deep learning to automate the classification of key Indian identity documents like **PAN Card**, **Aadhar**, **Driving Licence**, and **Passport**. The trained model can process scanned document images and accurately predict the document type based on visual features.

## üìö OVERVIEW

Document classification or categorization is a subfield of machine learning and NLP that assigns a document to one or more predefined categories. This project applies **image-based classification** using TensorFlow to automate document detection for KYC workflows.

---

## üßæ 1. Types of Documents:

**‚Ä¢ PAN Card**  
A 10-character alphanumeric identifier issued by the Indian Income Tax Department.

**‚Ä¢ Aadhar Card**  
A 12-digit identity number issued by the UIDAI, valid as both identity and address proof.

**‚Ä¢ Driving Licence**  
Legal authorization to drive vehicles, issued by Indian transport authorities.

**‚Ä¢ Passport**  
An official identity and travel document issued by the Indian Government.

## üñºÔ∏è 2. Image Classification

Image Classification is the process of assigning a label to an entire image based on its content. Here, it is used to classify scanned documents.

---

## üéØ 3. Object Detection

Object Detection combines **classification and localization**. This project uses TensorFlow‚Äôs Object Detection API to recognize PAN card features visually from the image.
